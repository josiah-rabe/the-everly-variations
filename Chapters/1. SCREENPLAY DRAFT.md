EXT. SMALL COUNTRY CHAPEL - DAY

RAIN. Not polite rain. The *real kind*—cold, persistent, drumming on the roof like a bad memory. Spring colors outside are blurred into one long bruise through the chapel's lead-crossed windows.

INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

The pews are sparsely filled. MURMURS. TISSUES. Subdued COLOGNE. The kind that tastes like a peppermint who showers once a year.

ROWAN (16) sits still in the second pew, close to the window. His black suit is neat, his posture military. Deep brown hair sets him apart from the graying heads around him. His eyes stay locked on the

PLAIN PINE CASKET

at the front. Unvarnished. No flowers. No photo montage. Just wood. Just Frank.

                              FRANKLIN (V.O.)
           It's just a box for this poor fool once he's dead. And plus,
           it's gonna spend most of its life six feet under.

The MINISTER stands at the pulpit. Soft, papery voice barely louder than the rain.

                              MINISTER
           Beloved in the Lord, in Holy Baptism, Franklin Winslow was clothed...

Rowan doesn't hear him. He's somewhere else—

FLASH TO:

INT. FRANKLIN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Franklin, bloodied rag in hand, fumbles with a phone. Rowan watches, frozen.

BACK TO:

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

A leak drips rhythmically into a puddle in the aisle. Rowan blinks. Still present.

                              MINISTER (O.S.)
           Franklin Winslow was a steady man. A quiet man. He never said much, 
           but when he did, those around him listened.

                              ROWAN (V.O.)
                          (dry)
           False. They waited for him to stop so they could talk.

Eyes shift. A beat. All heads turn toward Rowan. Just checking. He doesn't move.

                              MINISTER (O.S.)
           ...a mentor to some, a neighbor to many, and most recently, a foster parent.

The silence tightens. Rain eats the ends of sentences. Rowan’s shoulder slouches just slightly, like something invisible let go.

His leg bumps something: a VIOLIN CASE. Worn, weathered. Loyal.

                              ROWAN (V.O.)
           Oh. Forgot you were there.

The door CREAKS. Rain grows louder—then softer again. Someone’s entered.

Rowan doesn’t turn. But his back stiffens. Eyes wide.

APRIL (16) slides into the back pew. Hair braided, soaked. Jeans damp to the knees. She doesn’t speak. She doesn’t have to.

                              ROWAN (V.O.)
           She was here. She *was* here.

FLASH TO:

INT. GROUP HOME - NIGHT

Rowan lifts his pillow. A note. April’s handwriting: angry, brilliant, brutal.

BACK TO:

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

April’s breath is steady. Rain clings to the stained glass. Rowan’s gaze moves from the coffin to the window, where the world outside swims together in greens, grays, browns—a watercolor of confusion.

FADE OUT.
