Outside, it was like stepping underwater. The sound enclosed them, tapping and thudding on the ground with its heavy hands. The trees shook it from their branches like sudden shivers in the wind. It ran in little rivers down the gravel and dripped from Rowan's bangs into his collar. A man stood outside under an umbrella, shielding a leather briefcase with his coat. Well-groomed, middle-aged, and slightly stooped, he looked like he'd been rehearsing condolences in his rearview mirror. 

> "I assume you're Rowan Everly?" he asked, professionally. 

Rowan nodded automatically.

> "I'm David Ashland, Franklin's attorney. I believe we spoke briefly over the phone this Monday. As promised, this is the key he left you, which will provide you access to the house for now. While it's legally temporary, it is... completely uncontested."

Rowan took the envelope, feeling it softening from the humidity. It was heavier than it should have been.

>"The rest will take some time. He left you a lot but it's currently on probate. Review should begin early next week. I'm sorry there isn't more I can offer you today."

Rowan's grip tightened around the key, still in the envelope. He was still silent. Ashland nodded slightly and continued with his script.

> "I understand this time must be hard for you. If you need anything, you will find my card inside."

He stepped back, letting the rain mist his glasses. Rowan clearly saw his eyes move quickly to the violin and back to the two teens standing there in the rain. He shook his head almost imperceptibly and turned to his car with his umbrella still in his left hand, keys in the other. Rowan did the same, stepping out from under the high arched doorway, keys in hand. 

April followed into the washed-out grey of the gravel parking lot. She pulled her jacket collar up, crossing her arms tightly. No words yet. Rowan came at last to a mostly light blue Buick, with a crumpled front bumper, fading paint, and an abundance of rust. Straight out of the 90s, it looked like it hadn't aged too well. 

> "This it?" She asked, nodding slightly toward the car." 

> "Yep" he stated simply, letting the the end of his word pop slightly. 

April pulled her jacket tighter, though the water had already soaked through the shoulders. Her braid clung to her neck, dark and dripping. They stood there outside the car for around 40 seconds, but to both parties involved it felt more like a year. The rain continued on, drumming on the roof of the chapel, on the gravel, and on the faded hood of the car between them. 

> "You didn’t have to follow me out here," Rowan muttered finally.

> "What, you think I wanted to hear more about Franklin from some old guy I've never met?"

> "First off, that was Franklin's brother, who _could_ have been my uncle. Second of all, you didn't even know Frank! Why did you care enough to come to his funeral in the first place?"

> "'cause you knew him, and that matters."

Rowan raised an eyebrow skeptically. 

> "Or at least, I thought it did." She added in uncertain haste.

 He leaned on the fender of the car, setting the violin case carefully on the hood. 

 > "You were the one who said I was throwing everything away. D'you remember that? That note you left me under my pillow?"

April flushed and took a minuscule step back. "I didn't think you'd actually leave."

> "Well, apparently I did. Maybe I shouldn't have."

> "You don't think I know that? I hated you for weeks. But I'm here, okay? I came anyway. Does that not count for anything?"

Rowan exhaled, sharply. The rain plastered his bangs to his forehead. He had until this point, avoided direct eye contact, but he now looked her straight in the eyes. She looked just slightly scared.  

> "Why are you really here, April?"

She hesitated, and her eyes flickered from Rowan's to the sky for a second, then back to him. 

> "Because I didn’t want you to be alone."

That stopped him.

April didn’t move, didn’t back down from the silence that followed. She just stood there, drenched and slightly trembling, as if admitting it had cost her something.

> "You meant something to him. So… that meant something to me."

Rowan blinked rain from his eyelashes. The violin case sat between them, like a question neither had asked.

He nodded, just once.

> "Okay."

There was a pause. Rowan reached into his back pocket and pulled out a crumpled sticky note. He didn’t hand it to her directly—just held it out until she took it. The rain landed on it, smearing the blue pen and almost erasing any trace of it.

> "Frank’s landline. In case you… whatever."

April stared at the note, her lips pressed tight. Rowan picked up the violin case carefully and turned away. He opened the car door, and climbed in, setting the case in the passenger seat. He buckled it in. April gave him an inquisitive look, which he just saw in the edge of his vision.

His hands were shaking a little as he slid the key into the ignition. Not from the cold, nor the rain soaking through his suit, but rather from all the built up tension from that conversation he hadn't planned on having. As he turned the key, the engine turned over several times but refused to start. Rowan rolled his eyes, shook his head, and tried again. It started, sending a low shudder through the car. 

He didn't look back. Just pulled away from the gravel lot like it was enemy territory. The wipers squeaked across the windshield, smearing more than anything else. The Buick groaned uphill, feeling heavy with the rain and something else. 

_She said it meant something to her. That she cared about Frank because I cared about him._

His knuckles tightened on the wheel. 

_That's not how this works, April. You don't get to show up to my dad's funeral, well, my almost adoptive dad, and start caring all of a sudden. Not after months of silence and pointed notes under pillows and pretending Frank didn't exist. That_ I _didn't exist._

He felt something strange then. Not quite grief or anger, which he had gotten used to, but something hollow and deep.

_You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths._

He didn’t know where the thought came from, but it fit. He didn't know who "you" was. It could have been April, the pastor, that lawyer guy, _what was his name. Ashland, that was his name._ It could've even been Frank, for going and dying on him.

He turned sharply at the intersection, bald tires skidding on the wet pavement. He didn't care. 

_She looked a little scared. Just a little, when I looked into her eyes. She didn't want me to be alone. That's what she said. 

But that wasn't what stuck. It was what she said after. 

"_You meant something to him. So that meant something to me._"

Rowan blinked with intention and tried the wipers again. 

_That was a weird thing to say. Weird and sort of... something. 

_Brave. It was brave. And super weird._

Rowan took the next left and slowed down in front of a small old house on the edge of the neighborhood, a large metal building standing behind, white and tall, contrasting the peeling blue paint of the house. He pulled in to the driveway and parked, pulling the key out of the ignition. The rain kept drumming on the hood and the cracked windshield. 

---
In a dingy dorm-like group home, April sat cross-legged on her cot, the formerly damp sticky note flattened beside her phone. Her bag was half-packed, sitting on the ground, halfway beneath her bed. Her roommate was snoring softly.

She stared at the number for a second, glanced toward the door, picked up her phone, and dialed. 

---
Across town, Rowan was sitting barefoot at the table in Franklin's kitchen. The floor was cold, and there were dishes in the sink. They were clean but they never got around to being put away. The refrigerator buzzed faintly. 

The phone rang, its 2000s-era digital ringtone disturbing the silence. Rowan got up and answered on the fourth ring.

> "You gave me the number," April said, simply. Then added, "Though you didn't say I could use it."

Rowan almost cracked a smile. "Didn't say you couldn't."

> "I'm leaving."

Phone cord stretched taut as he grabbed the base off the wall, Rowan breathed, walked to the window, and pulled back the curtain. The rain hadn't stopped. 

> "Where?"

> "Maine. My family had a property up there. I'm just so tired of all of it. These group homes with people who pretend to care. I have a plan. I've been working on it for years."

>"And what, you just... disappear?"

>"Yeah. I do... I am."

The silence returned. Rowan rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock. It read 8:34. That couldn't be right. Must've stopped again.

> "Listen... You're going to need somewhere to start." Rowan exhaled. "Here. 2195 Holden Ridge Road. Start here."

>"Are you coming with me?"

He hesitated as the rain drummed against the window. His fingers played with the peeling edge of the linoleum countertop.

>"Don't know yet."

He already did. It was obvious. He had to get his violin on the move since the upcoming legal scrutiny of everything around him would blow its cover. He also happened to be unable to do that single-handedly.

She hung up first. The screen still glowed in her right hand, the cracked screen displaying the dialer. It suddenly felt radioactively traceable. And stupid. 

She stared a second longer. Then, fast and deliberate, she hit the home button, dove into _Settings_, fingers flying. _Reset device. Erase all content. Confirm._ The phone paused, then went black. She shoved it under her pillow like a corpse, and it was gone. 

Now there was just the sound of her own breathing, shallow and quick, and he humming HVAC vent that had always sounded like whispering to her. She straightened herself on the small rug next to her bed, glanced at her roommate who had turned over but still appeared to be sleeping. 

Her duffle bag was already packed. It had been for days. "_Emergency-only,_" she'd told herself. Just in case. But now the zipper opened like a portal, ready to be used for real. She slipped the laptop in first, an old, battered ThinkPad that she had been given by a foster home years ago. While technically outdated, it was loyal, and, more importantly, hidden better than most people's diaries. No one in this house ever knew it existed. 

Then:

- Four complete outfits, each layered and mixable
- Knit gloves, a red beanie and scarf
- Her well-loved dark-brown converse, and a fabric belt to match
- Standard toiletries packed neatly in a clear travel pouch, along with a cloth laundry bag from the closet.
- A black wallet with **$268 in small bills**, her nearly-expired learner’s permit, an expired zoo pass, and a bus transfer stub with half a smiley face drawn on it.
- Paperback _Jane Eyre_, creased but clean
- A sketchbook full of drawings, thoughts, and secrets, along with three ballpoint pens and a mechanical pencil with exactly 128 spare leads 
- Folded road map with hand-drawn notations and loops
- Small, battered Gideon Bible with a pressed violet at Psalm 88
- Granola bars, peanut butter crackers, hotel-size Nutella, and 3 meal-replacement bars wrapped in a black bandana, plus water purification tablets that she stored in an old pill bottle
- $34 in quarters, stored in old film canisters.
- A collapsible camping spoon, pocketknife, canteen, and flashlight (with extra batteries, you could never be sure you wouldn't need extra batteries)
- Mini sewing kit and a tight roll of duct tape
- Space blanket, Bic lighter, double-bagged matches, and an emergency poncho folded into a snack-size Ziplock bag
- 20 feet of tightly coiled Paracord,
- And finally, a canvas tote bag, folded flat.
  
She slipped on a pair of black running shoes, shrugged on her sturdy olive-green utility jacket, and hoisted the bag onto her shoulder. Stepping over to her dresser, she closed the looted drawers and picked up her necklace– an elegant little owl charm on a thin, silver chain. It was the only piece of jewelry she owned, and the only thing from her mother that wasn't a Bitcoin wallet or secondhand. She put it on, the clasp clicking into place behind her neck like armor.

Then it began. She walked quietly over to the door and cracked it.

The hallway was beyond dim as she slid out like a breath, closing the door neatly behind her. 

_Don't squeak. Don't trip. Do not for anything stop._

Every inch of the house felt different now, in the same way all spaces do when they are illuminated only by the lights of city night. She crept past room 4; Lena's. Then room 6. Then the admin office. She skirted the creaky third floorboard by instinct. She had previously been jealous that the boys could live upstairs with the dormers windows and the simple joy of living on the top floor. Now, however, she was immensely thankful that the first floor had easy access to the kitchen exit. 

The fridge hummed omnipresently as the clock on the microwave blinked 2:13 AM. The back door loomed like the end of a tunnel. She reached for the deadbolt. It clicked, and loudly. Too loudly.

She froze.

Nothing.

She exhaled and opened the door just enough to slip into the night. The air hit her like a slap. It was humid, laced with the faint smell of dew and asphalt. No one was outside. There were no cameras on this side of the building.

She stepped off the porch, the duffle bag bouncing across her back. She kept walking, and she wouldn't stop. Tomorrow morning, she would be someone else's missed role call to figure out.
