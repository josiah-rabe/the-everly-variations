It was raining. Of course it was. It wasn't soft either-- It was the real kind, cold and persistent, drumming steadily on the chapel roof. People were murmuring, but you'd have to lean in to hear them over the rain. It smudged the lead-crossed windows of the chapel, flattening the spring colors outside into one long bruise of confusion. 

It seemed about right to the boy sitting close to the window in the second pew. Just a month ago, adoption was finally within reach. He’d waited for that day since he was four, but the man who had become an emotional father to him, and was willing and eager to become his legal father was lying, nothing now but a corpse, in the casket at the front of the small chapel. It had all happened so fast, and as Rowan tried to recall, it seemed only a day ago that he had found Franklin, bloodied rag in hand, calling an ambulance for himself. But on further thought, it seemed to be months ago. The windows provided perfect imagery. 

He sat upright, unmoving, in his black suit. He would have disappeared perfectly  intothe rest of the congregation if it were not for his deep brown hair, which interrupted the pattern of graying heads in the pews around him. There were thirty or forty people, most of them looking anywhere but the coffin. The couple beside Rowan leaned toward each other, damp tissues in hand. The fidgety man in front of him wore a cologne so strong he could nearly taste it.

It tasted gross, like a peppermint who showered on a yearly basis. 

The sound of voices in the chapel slowly faded into silence, aside from the incessant rain, as the minister instructed the congregation to rise and began the service in a mild, papery voice.

> "Beloved in the Lord, in Holy Baptism, Franklin Winslow was clothed with the robe of Christ's righteousness that covered..."

But Rowan was deep in thought again. He revisited the painful memories of the man who cared for him and wanted nothing but the best for him. They had begun to make sense, and he laid them out carefully as not to forget them, no matter how much emotion he felt remembering. He took up staring at the simple pine casket, plain and unvarnished. Franklin would have hated anything fancier. "It's just a box for this poor fool once he's dead, and plus, it's going to be 6 feet under the ground for the majority of it's lifetime," Rowan remembered him saying cynically a week ago, when the doctors reported he had not much time to live. There were no flowers, no photos, and no slideshow of awkward family moments. 

Rowan was nudged out of his own mind, and into the chapel, the roof of which had apparently developed a leak, given the small puddle collecting in the aisle. 

The Pastor had begun the eulogy.

> "Franklin Winslow was a steady man. He was a quiet man. He never said much, but when he did, those around him listened."

*False,* Rowan thought. *People waited for him to stop talking so they could start again. They weren't listening.* 

The rain proved useful for tuning out those around him. It wasn't loud, but _dense._ It swallowed the ends of sentences, making the silences feel far deeper than they had any right to.

> "He was a mentor to some," the pastor continued, "a neighbor to many, and, most recently, a foster parent."

For a moment, every eye in the room shifted towards Rowan.

Just checking.

He moved not one muscle, but it landed like a blow. In that fraction of a second, with two dozen stares digging into him, he was sent reeling straight off a cliff: anger, disappointment, that hollow sort of sorrow he was starting to get used to The eyes finally moved away, and Rowan moved for the first time since the service began. He slouched, just slightly, like some string holding him upright and on edge finally had mercy on him. As he moved forward, his right leg just grazed something. 

It was a violin case, it's leather-textured metal black and worn around the edges.

"*Oh hi. I forgot you were there for a second,*" Rowan thought to the case. It had been with him longer than most people had, the entire time carrying and protecting an instrument so mysterious and coveted that the couple sitting next to him would have picked a seat not so close if they knew even half of what it hid. 

The pastor had moved on, oblivious, like the rest, to the mystery in the case, and was now pontificating on how “the Lord gives and takes away.” Rowan wasn’t listening. The sound of the downpour outside continued relentlessly. Accompanied by the creak of a door, it grew clearer for a moment, and, just as if the sequence had been played in reverse, the rhythmless tapping became muffled again. Rowan didn't turn to see who it was, but he straightened his posture and his eyes went wide in surprise. 

She had quickly slipped into the chapel, slipping in turn back into Rowan's life. 

He had known April Allard for some time, having originally met her in the group foster home they were placed in three years ago. Seven months back, when Rowan was moved into Frank's home, she was furious, seeing his acceptance of the new situation as a betrayal. The night before he left, she managed to sneak into the boy's side of the group home and slip a note under his pillow, written in words sharp enough to leave a mark. They did. 

But she was here now. He would know that step anywhere. It was a little heavier and sounded almost hesitant, but he knew it was her. April moved quietly down the side aisle, the rain clinging to her braid, her jeans darkened and damp to the knees. She slipped into the pew behind Rowan. She said not a word. 

As the service continued, Rowan was hardly able to pay attention. All he could think about was why _she_ was here. He felt a flurry of emotions, heaped on top of everything else, but one thing stood out: confusion. None if it made sense. He moved his eyes from the coffin to the window above it, blending greens, grays, and browns into the same quiet confusion coiled inside him.
