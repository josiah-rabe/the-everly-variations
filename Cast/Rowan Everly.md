## Relationships
- **Franklin Winslow:** Surrogate father figure; calm, stoic, moral. The only adult who ever truly cared for Rowan.
- **April Allard:** Friend from the group home. Sharp, grounded, emotionally brave. Hurt by his leaving. Their bond is deep and complicated—slow-burn intimacy, not romantic at first.

## Internal Conflict
Rowan doesn’t know how to ask for or receive love. Trust feels unsafe. He craves connection but fears what will happen if he tries.

## External Conflict
With the system closing in and no legal permanence, Rowan must choose between staying behind or running—perhaps forever. April’s presence raises the stakes.

## Symbolism
- **Rain:** His emotional undercurrent—ever-present, sometimes oppressive
- **Violin:** His true voice and emotional outlet
- **Keys:** Control, inheritance, the burden of unwanted responsibility
