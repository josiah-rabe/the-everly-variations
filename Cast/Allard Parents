# Allard Parents

## Clara Allard (née Whitcombe) – Mother
- **Status:** Deceased  
- Watercolor painter and elementary school art teacher  
- Gentle, introverted, and adoring of April  
- Known for her odd sense of humor and quiet strength  
- Wore layered scarves and boots  
- Loved the woods, quiet moments, and small beautiful things  
- Left behind notebooks and sketchbooks April never got to keep

## Leo Allard – Father
- **Status:** Deceased  
- Former park ranger; practical, woodsy  
- Kept emergency supplies at home—a habit April inherited  
- Deep voice, warm presence, but struggled to express emotion  
- His old field notebooks inspired April’s own journaling habits

> **Note:** April never talks about her parents unless cornered. Her grief is old but raw. She remembers their smells, their phrases, their warmth—but not their voices. That haunts her more than she’ll admit.

# Possible Thematic Echoes
- Parents’ legacy lives on in April’s preparedness, creativity, and emotional restraint  
- Their memory is not spiritual or ghostly like Rowan's relations, but quietly woven into her instincts  
- Could be tied subtly into motifs (e.g. a scarf pattern, a phrase, a forest trail) for later story resonance
