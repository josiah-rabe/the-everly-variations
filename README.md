# The Rowan Variations
## A Brief Introduction
*The Rowan Variations* is a worldbuilding and storytelling project focused on two orphans who witness for themselves faith, survival, and the enduring art of music during the Thirty Years' War.

## An Even Briefer History
*The Rowan Variations* is an ongoing project of mine. I began formulating it in late 2023 after viewing the hauntingly complete *Moonrise Kingdom* by Wes Anderson. In it's original incarnation, it was a "headcanon" clone of the aforementioned, central to two orphans escaping from an orphanage to some land that magically appeared (i guess) in Wyoming. 

In June of 2025, I revisited the idea and attempted to write the first "chapters" of the story. That version's worldbuilding and general movement was far more complex and entertainable, but a good friend of mine who is a far better writer than me talked me out of continuing. By all means, she was right. 

As of August of 2025, I am introducing this concept in its third and potentially final overall state. It will feature the orphans, named April and Rowan, on a hero's journey set in 1546, opening in German Wittenberg, at the funeral service of the late Dr. Martin Luther.

It is my aim to build an accurate and natural world, real and honest characters, and a plot that will take the reader willingly with it. The actual writing proper can wait for when I or another, better writer can breath the breath of life into the the framework I build now.
