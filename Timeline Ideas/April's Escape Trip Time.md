## Estimated Trip Time: 2:30 AM Escape to Arrival (Franklin's house)

Assuming:
She’s in a group home somewhere in the western or northern part of Des Moines (many are tucked away in residential zones).
Franklin lives in a slightly run-down but quiet area on the south or southeast side—near the river, but not quite out in the country.
She’s not being picked up but walking from the nearest bus stop after the last transfer.

##Breakdown:

- **Wait at First Stop (2:30 AM–2:40 AM)**
Minimal wait—Des Moines buses run limited late-night service. Let's say she gets lucky.

- **First Bus Ride (2:40 AM–3:05 AM)**
Local bus takes her east toward downtown. Slower at night with few stops, 20–25 minutes.

- **Transfer & Wait (3:05 AM–3:20 AM)**
Small transfer window at a central depot. She's cautious, checking shadows.

- **Second Bus Ride (3:20 AM–3:45 AM)**
Heads south/southeast, closer to Franklin’s neighborhood. Drops her at a quiet stop near a 24-hour laundromat or closed taquería.

- **Final Walk (3:45 AM–4:15 AM)**
25–30 minute walk through sleeping streets, industrial lots, and older residential zones. She avoids major roads, wearing her hood low. Her feet are probably sore.

##Total: ~1 hour 45 minutes.
- April arrives around 4:15 AM
