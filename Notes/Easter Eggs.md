#### Owl
- **Recurring Appearance**: A barn owl appears at significant moments—silent observer when Rowan plays, or during moments of decision. Maybe it's even nesting in the abandoned barn. Might be Franklin, who knows
- **Rowan’s Sketches**: He has drawn it multiple times without realizing it.
- **April’s Necklace:** A small, elegant, sliver owl
#### Psalm 88
- **Psalm 88 Reference**: Scribbled on a paper in Rowan’s violin case. It's dated the day his mom died.
- __April's Bible__: Pressed Violet at Psalm 88
- **A page from an old hymnal**: Marked at hymn #88 with an odd margin note—handwriting matches Franklin’s.
#### Other
- **Franklin’s Car Manual**: It's hosted as a private Git repo. Rowan finds a printed commit log inside the glove box, with commit messages like:
    - `fix: ignition timing
    - `feat: per
- **A file named `README.md`**: Hidden in April’s ThinkPad, detailing her “mission parameters” for dealing with Rowan.
- Rowan at one point mutters, “I wish life had version control.”
- **License Plate**: On Franklin’s car: `AWN-042`, hinting at "Awan" and _The Hitchhiker’s Guide_.
- **Graffiti in the Barn**: [[RAE, Barn]]. Could stand for “Rowan and April Everly." or maybe not, who knows.
