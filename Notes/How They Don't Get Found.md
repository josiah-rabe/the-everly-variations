## Factors That Affect Their Chances

### 1. How Long They've Been Gone

- **Immediately after disappearance:** _High alert_Photos distributed, case active, their names run through missing persons databases.
- **2–4 weeks later:**The system starts slowing down, unless there's a specific lead. Public memory fades quickly.
- **Months later:**If they’ve stayed low-profile and moved far enough, the chances of recognition drop _dramatically_—especially in small towns.

---
### 2. Age and Appearance

- 16-year-olds who look clean, calm, and composed don’t raise alarms.
- April and Rowan are_quiet_, not flashy. They blend. They’re smart.
- They’d likely be seen as just another set of rural teens—especially if they:
    - Buy with cash.
    - Don’t use real names.
    - Avoid places with cameras (gas stations, chain stores).

---

### 3. The Town Itself

- **Tourist towns or cities:** Higher risk. More strangers = more observant people.
- **Backwoods Maine towns with 900 people and one general store:**They’re fine. Locals might gossip, but no one’s calling the FBI.

---

### 4. If the Authorities Are Actively Searching

- If the violin has already drawn serious attention: more risk.
- If Rowan and April vanished with no incident or media attention:_much_ safer.
- Foster systems are overwhelmed. Unless someone’s specifically looking for_them_(like an investigator or bounty hunter character), they’re not top priority.

## Ways to Stay Under the Radar

- **Change clothes and hair regularly**(April could cut Rowan’s hair, for example).
- **Use aliases**for small interactions—Rowan might go by “Ray” or something close.
- **Cash only, no phones, no internet cafés.**
- **Avoid newsworthy behavior**—no fights, no police calls, no vandalism, no spotlight.

## Realistic Outcome:

They can walk into towns, buy supplies, and talk to people_as long as they keep moving and don’t linger too long_. Think_“always slightly looking over your shoulder,”_but not_“immediate sirens.”_

If you ever want them to get_nearly caught_, it can be something like:

- A missing poster in a gas station.
- An off-duty officer getting suspicious.
- A well-meaning local trying to “help.”
