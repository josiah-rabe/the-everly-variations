### Artifact: The Map to the Cabin
**Type:** Folded paper road map, circa early 2000s  
**Condition:** Worn, soft edges, one coffee stain, and at least two taped-over tears  
**Owner:** April Allard (inherited from her mother)  
**Purpose:** Leads Rowan and April to her great-grandfather’s cabin near Bridgton, Maine
#### Physical Description
- **Dimensions:** Standard glove-box foldout size, roughly 24" x 36" when unfolded
- **Material:** Thin, matte paper—creased in all the usual places, but especially down the center fold
- **Details:**
    - Northern New England roadways marked in pale blue
    - A bright **red pen circle** around a plot of land northwest of Bridgton
    - Notes in two distinct handwritings: April’s mother (in faded black ink) and April (in ballpoint blue)
    - A **coffee stain** blurs the state border between New Hampshire and Maine
    - Masking tape holds together the top left corner, where the map was once torn during a fight April doesn’t talk about.
#### Story Function
- Originally part of a family box of keepsakes April’s mother kept hidden.
- The red-circled land belonged to April’s great-grandfather—a logging cabin he built himself in the late 1960s.
- It contains scribbled route corrections, handwritten landmarks (like "old iron bridge" and "gas station with the bear sign"), and an “X” that may or may not indicate the actual cabin.
- **Later**, the map becomes an item others seek—those who want to find _them_.
#### Symbolism
- A reminder of a lost generation and broken heritage
- A bridge between April’s childhood and her chosen future
- A metaphor for their entire journey: vague, risky, but real
