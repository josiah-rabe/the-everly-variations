Rowan let himself be pulled into the sway, though he moved like someone expecting a trap. His hand rested awkwardly on April’s waist, hovering a little like he wasn’t sure if he had the right. She noticed, of course.

> “You can actually _touch_ me, you know,” she muttered with a smirk.

> “I’m respecting personal space.”

> “We’re literally dancing.”

> “Under _protest_.”

She stepped a little closer, narrowing the gap between them. “Noted. Now stop dancing like a haunted Victorian orphan.”

> “You wound me.”

> “You wound _me_ by missing every beat.”

> “I didn’t know there _was_ a beat,” Rowan hissed, glancing around as if music might manifest from the firewood.

April laughed—really laughed, and Rowan felt it more than heard it. Her body shook lightly with it, her forehead tipping forward just enough to bump gently into his.

He froze.

She didn’t pull back.

And for a second—just a second—the fire seemed louder. Or maybe his heartbeat.

April’s voice was low. “You okay?”

> “No,” Rowan said truthfully, quietly. “But you make it suck less.”

She leaned back, not enough to pull away, just enough to look at him full-on. Her hand, still holding his, gave the gentlest squeeze.

> “Guess I’m good for something, then.”

> “Tolerable,” he replied, deadpan.

April’s grin returned, and with it, a sparkle of mischief.

She stepped suddenly to the side in the middle of a turn—and Rowan, not expecting it, tripped straight over her foot.

He went down with a startled yelp, pulling her with him in a clatter of limbs and flannel and the faint _thud_ of regret.

> “OW—”

> “That was _your_ fault!”

> “_You_ moved!”

> “You were supposed to _follow!_”

> “I was trying not to—are you _on my ribs?!_”

They landed half-on, half-beside each other, tangled like two marionettes dropped mid-performance. April’s braid had somehow ended up across Rowan’s face. He spat hair.

> “This is how I die,” he wheezed. “Buried alive under a theater kid.”

> “If I’m a theater kid, you’re a brooding main character with chronic emotional constipation.”

> “I _am_ the moment.”

> “You’re a _disaster_,” she corrected, poking his cheek.

> “You kissed me first,” he said without thinking.

Pause.

Both froze. The fire crackled.

April blinked. “That… is both true and irrelevant to the current—”

> “Just sayin’,” Rowan muttered, staring at the ceiling, cheeks going the color of overripe strawberries. “I have _receipts_.”

April lowered her head beside his, lips almost at his ear.

> “Say that again,” she whispered, voice low and joking, “and I’m kissing you _again_ just to prove a point.”

He didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

> “Threats,” he said finally. “She’s armed.”

> “You bet your sweet Stradivarius I am.”

They stayed there, flat on the floor, hearts thudding, grins sneaking out like sunlight through curtains. Her hand found his again, fingers fitting between his like it was the most natural thing in the world.

> “Still cold?” she asked softly.

Rowan shook his head, breath catching. “No. I’m good.”

Another pause. A beat of peace.

Then:

> “We should probably get off the floor before one of us gets a splinter.”

> “Or starts crying.”

> “That was a _one-time_—”

> “Mmm-hmm.”

April sat up, but not before leaning down and planting a kiss on his temple.

Just long enough to make his brain reboot.

Rowan stared up at the ceiling, eyes wide.

> “I didn’t say anything sarcastic and she still kissed me,” he whispered. “New patch just dropped.”
