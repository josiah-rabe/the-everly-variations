They were supposed to be there by now.

The map said the turnoff was a quarter mile back, but no such turnoff had appeared—just trees, gravel, and the same stubborn ridge of pine shadows thickening with the dusk. Rowan pulled the car over onto a patch of flattened grass and shut off the engine.

The silence after driving always came like a slap. Then came the insects.

April leaned forward, peering through the windshield. “There’s something up ahead.”

Rowan followed her gaze. A dark outline just past the treeline—roof caved slightly in, a hint of red paint peeling off planks weathered to gray.

“Barn,” he said.

“Should we check it out?”

“Better than sitting here waiting to be murdered by mosquitoes.”

The air was thick with the scent of sap and mildew as they pushed through the trees. The barn’s doors hung unevenly on their hinges, wide enough to slip through sideways. Inside, it was cooler—air woven through with haydust and time.

April exhaled softly. “Creepy.”

“No, _atmospheric_,” Rowan corrected. “If it were creepy, we’d have heard footsteps by now.”

She gave him a look, but the tension eased a little.

They wandered inside, poking around. There was a rusted scythe on a nail, a toppled bucket, the remains of some rodent nest in a tractor seat. Rowan found the ladder up to the hayloft and climbed without speaking. She followed.

At the top, dust floated in golden beams from the slatted roof. There wasn’t much—just a few scattered boards, a broken crate, and, carved deep into the beam opposite them, three letters.

**R. A. E.**

Rowan squinted at it. Then again.

April tilted her head. “You write that?”

He shook his head. “Not me.”

They stared at it for a second. There was something about the boldness of it—done all at once, no hesitation.

She said nothing more, just slowly sat down near the beam and traced one of the letters lightly with her thumb.

Rowan caught himself smiling. Not out of humor. Just something warm in the chest that hadn’t quite become a thought.

April didn’t look at him, but she did shift slightly, sitting a little closer than before.

He looked at the letters again.

**R. A. E.**

He felt his cheeks go warm before he could stop it. Stupid. It didn’t _mean_ anything.

She noticed. Didn’t say a word.

Just pulled something from her pocket—a pencil, of course—and made the tiniest mark beneath the final **E**. So faint you’d miss it unless you knew to look.

Rowan raised an eyebrow.

April just smiled, gently.

“For the record,” she said, brushing off her jeans, “this is still atmospheric. Not creepy.”
