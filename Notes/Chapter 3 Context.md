### Status
- **Technically missing.** She vanished from her group home without permission, and they _will_ have reported it.
- The urgency depends on how long she's been gone—_so far, less than 48 hours_, right?
- If she’s seen by anyone who knows her, she could be picked up. Even if Rowan has keys, **she has no legal excuse to be at Franklin’s house.**
### Short-Term Tensions
- Rowan and April know they can’t stay long. Franklin’s death will trigger a **review of Rowan’s placement**, and April’s presence at the house could get them both in deeper trouble.
- The house is quiet, but not safe.
### How April Feels
- Relieved to be with Rowan, but uneasy. Constantly listening for knocks, voices, cars.
- Wears Rowan’s hoodie or jacket when they go out to reduce recognizability.
- Has a preexisting idea about Franklin’s house being a “pass-through” place—not home.
## How This Affects Chapter 3
We can thread these elements in:
- They keep the lights off at night.
- They only go out once, together, to grab some supplies, and it’s tense.
- April talks about the **Maine property** like it’s the only chance she has to _not_ be found.
- Rowan’s the one dragging his feet—not because he wants to stay, but because _running feels like saying goodbye to Franklin again._
